# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-using-9-ML-models
This project develops a comprehensive loan prediction system using nine different machine learning models. The goal is to predict loan eligibility based on customer details provided while filling online application forms.

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict loan eligibility using a variety of machine learning models based on customer data from application forms.

# Data Description
The dataset includes multiple features such as gender, marital status, education, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, and property area among others. This data is used to predict whether a loan would be approved or not.


## Machine Learning Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**: 
  - Serves as a baseline for performance comparison. It's straightforward yet effective for binary classification tasks.

- **Decision Tree & Random Forest**: 
  - These ensemble methods excel in handling non-linear data, improving accuracy and robustness through multiple decision trees.

- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)**: 
  - Ideal for high-dimensional spaces, focusing on creating the best decision boundaries between classes.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: 
  - A simple, instance-based learning method that classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions).

- **Gradient Boosting & AdaBoost**: 
  - Boosting methods that combine several weak learners to form a strong predictive model, enhancing the decision-making capabilities.

- **XGBoost**: 
  - An advanced, efficient implementation of gradient boosting known for its speed and performance, commonly used in winning Kaggle competitions.


# Model Evaluation
Each model is evaluated based on precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. The results are visualized to compare the effectiveness of each model under different configurations.
