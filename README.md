# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-using-9-ML-models
This project develops a comprehensive loan prediction system using nine different machine learning models. The goal is to predict loan eligibility based on customer details provided while filling online application forms.

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict loan eligibility using a variety of machine learning models based on customer data from application forms.

# Data Description
The dataset includes multiple features such as gender, marital status, education, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, and property area among others. This data is used to predict whether a loan would be approved or not.

# Models Used
Logistic Regression: Basic yet powerful, used as a baseline for performance comparison.
Decision Tree & Random Forest: Ensemble methods that handle non-linear data effectively.
SVM (Support Vector Machines): Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
K-Nearest Neighbors: A simple, instance-based learning method.
Gradient Boosting & AdaBoost: Boosting methods that combine multiple weak learners to create a strong learner.
XGBoost: An optimized distributed gradient boosting library.

# Model Evaluation
Each model is evaluated based on precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. The results are visualized to compare the effectiveness of each model under different configurations.
